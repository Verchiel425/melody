## Media Downloader App

An app that lets you download media from various sources

### What does it do?

The app downloads media via YouTube links. When you download a Spotify track, it does not actually rip the track directly. First, it searches for the song on YouTube, then it grabs the YouTube download link and downloads from there. 

As you can imagine, there are times when the media you are downloading will not match one-for-one, but there are safety nets to ensure that does not happen very often.
